# Cluster-young-football-players
Our subject for the Capstone is applying Machine Learning to cluster football players. In detail, our
project aims to look at the class of young players and cluster them into groups based on their
attributes. We will filter and consider the players who are promised based on their potential
attributes.
The FIFA dataset is not just totally the characters in a video game but it's based on the football players
in the real world, so we can apply it to some extent practical work. For example, the football
specialists like managers, scouts, or coaches can refer to this analysis as the first step to find and
target new young players appropriate to their teams or match their expectations. Also, they can
discover the similarities and differences between the clusters to build different lines up and static. Of
course, this analysis will be helpful for the FIFA gamers too.
